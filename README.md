Rancid Tomatillos MVP; Paired Project; Module 3

## Description

The Rancid Tomatoes application allows a user to view a library of movies from an API. Within this library the user is capable of sorting and searching through their library. This application was built using the React Framework with the accompaning JSX syntax, React hooks and tested with a combination of React-Testing-Library and Jest. Our stretch goal included creating a watch-list where users can add and remove movies. The associated technologies used for the stretch goal included an Express server that was deployed using Heroku. This allowed the users to update their watch list using CRUD methods.

## Usage

Navigate to the deployed site on Github Pages.

- On load all movies are viewable in a library

- Users can search movies by title

- Users can sort movies

  - Newest - Oldest
  - Oldest - Newest

- Users can update the watch list using

  - The + symbol
  - The - symbol

- Users can view their watch list

- Users can select a movie to view

- Upon selecting a movie to view

  - The user can view more information about the movie
  - The user can view a trailer of the movie

  ## Chalenges and Wins

  - **Challenges : **
  - Test driven development was challenging with learning two new libraries on a new framework. Async testing proved to be a tricky task. Incorporating Jest with React Spring is a continous challenge we are working on.

  - **Wins :**
  - For this being our first React project, we made a lot of progress using a new framework and supplemental technologies. We were driven to extend our knowledge by including new tech we were not as comfortable with. In the end, testing was a big win as we pushed through and made sure to test all necessary unit and integration tests.
